This file will contain functions for packaging up requests having to do with
member objects. It will then import and instantiate the Client class,
authenticate, then use its methods to make requests with properly formatted
data.

Question: Do we want to restrict to just GET requets, or will we need to
ever POST to modify members via web properties?
